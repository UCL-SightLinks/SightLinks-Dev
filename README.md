# SightLinks Development Repository

Welcome to the SightLinks Development Repository! We hope you can use these tools to build accessible systems and make the world a more welcoming place. This repository contains various tools and resources designed to facilitate the development of the SightLinks project, focusing on data generation, annotation, model training, feature extraction and much more. These are the tools used to develop the SightLinks system, as well as some addiitional Beta features that can bring the project even further. 

### Note: There is a significant overlap between SightLinks-Main and SightLinks-Dev, with many of the functions overlapping.

## Project Overview

SightLinks is an initiative aimed at enhancing accessibility mapping through automated analysis of satellite imagery. By accurately detecting features relevant to wheelchair users and individuals with mobility needs, SightLinks contributes to the development of more inclusive navigation solutions. The system achieves high reliability in feature detection while maintaining strict safety standards to prevent false positives.

## Repository Structure

- **DevelopmentTools/**: This directory includes tools and scripts used for data generation, annotation, model training, and feature pre-processing. These resources are essential for processing satellite imagery and training machine learning models to detect accessibility features, but that's not the only thing they're limited to being used for!

- **LegacyVersion/**: This directory contains previous versions of the tools and scripts, preserved for reference and potential reuse.

## Getting Started

To begin using the tools in this repository:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UCL-SightLinks/SightLinks-Dev.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python installed, then install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Navigate to the Development Tools Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd SightLinks-Dev/DevelopmentTools
   ```
4. **Run the Tools**: Follow the instructions provided in each file's documentation to generate data, annotate images, or train models. 

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to enhance the functionality and efficiency of the tools in this project, in fact we encourage it. To contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-name
   ```
3. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Description of feature or fix"
   ```
4. Push to your branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-name
   ```
5. Open a pull request detailing your changes. (we will most likely accept, there's a lot of improvements to be made!)
